# Training

The training is a very important part to create a model. 
Using an existing datatset the nnUNet will be trained and the outcome will be a strong medele of 3D segmentation.

To correctly use the nnUNet_medseg programe the user has to follow the direction line to correctly use the program and dont loose any data.

Mainy case are available with this programme


The user will only have interactions with the Input_nnUNet_train, the Input_nnUNet_train and the exe_train.py. 
It is very important that the user has to COPY his dataset in the Input_nnUNet_train because the dataset will be correcly sorted for the nnUNet model and deleted after the operation.
