The train folder is composed by different folders that the nnUNet need to correclty run. All the different subfolders are listed in the image below
The user will only have interactions with the Input_nnUNet_train, the Input_nnUNet_train and the exe_train.py. 
It is very important that the user has to COPY his dataset in the Input_nnUNet_train because the dataset will be correcly sorted for the nnUNet model and deleted after the operation.
